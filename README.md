# 🚀 Implementation of Delay Tolerant Routing Protocol using NS-3

A simulation-based implementation of **Epidemic Routing** in **Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs)** using the **NS-3 Network Simulator**.  
This project demonstrates message propagation in intermittently connected MANETs using the **store–carry–forward** mechanism.

## 📘 About the Project

Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networks enable communication even when stable end-to-end paths fail.  
This project implements:

- 📡 Epidemic Routing Protocol  
- 🚶 Random Waypoint Mobility Model

## ▶️ How to Run the Simulation

### 1️⃣ Install NS-3  
Download from official NS-3 releases.

### 2️⃣ Copy the source code  
Move `/src/` contents into your NS-3 scratch folder:

```
ns-3.xx/scratch/
```

### 3️⃣ Build the project

```
./waf build
```

### 4️⃣ Run the simulation

```
./waf --run epidemic-routing
```

### 5️⃣ View the visualization in NetAnim

```
netanim epidemic.xml
```

## 📊 Simulation Outputs

This project generates:

### ✔ Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)
Indicates delivery success in DTN environments.

### ✔ Average End-to-End Delay
Shows latency caused by mobility, queueing and message replication.

### ✔ Packet Loss
Increases with:
- mobility,
- network congestion,
- node density.

### ✔ NetAnim Visualization
Displays:
- node mobility  
- message advertisement  
- message forwarding  
- packet flow animations  

All outputs are stored in:

```
/results/
/netanim/
```
